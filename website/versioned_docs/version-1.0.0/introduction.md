# Introduction

‚ö°Ô∏è Docusaurus will help you ship a **beautiful documentation site in no time**.

üí∏ Building a custom tech stack is expensive. Instead, **focus on your content** and just write Markdown files.

üí• Ready for more? Use **advanced features** like versioning, i18n, search and theme customizations.

üíÖ Check the **[best Docusaurus sites](/showcase?tags=favorite)** for inspiration and read some **[testimonials](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/timelines/1392048416872706049)**.

üßê Docusaurus is a **static-site generator**. It builds a **single-page application** with fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of **React** to make your site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box **documentation features** but can be used to create **any kind of site** (personal website, product, blog, marketing landing pages, etc).


Let's discover **MetaPy in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.6 or above
- [Pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_download/)
- [MetaTrader 4](https://www.metatrader4.com/ja) or [MetaTrader5](https://www.metatrader5.com/ja)


## Install MetaPy EA

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Install MetaPy from pip

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
